## Data Aggregation and Preprocessing

- **Data Sources**: Detail the sources from which resale flat price data is collected, such as government databases, APIs, or third-party datasets.
  
- **Data Cleaning**: Explain the steps involved in cleaning the raw data, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies.
  
- **Feature Engineering**: Discuss any additional features engineered from the raw data that could enhance analysis, such as calculating price per square meter or creating categorical variables for location.

- **Data Integration**: If combining multiple datasets, describe the process of integrating them and ensuring data integrity.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Statistical Summaries**: Provide summary statistics for key variables like price, location, and size of flats.
  
- **Visualizations**: Showcase various types of visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to uncover patterns and correlations in the data.
  
- **Temporal Analysis**: Analyze how resale flat prices have changed over time, identifying trends and seasonal patterns.
  
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Utilize maps to visualize the distribution of resale flat prices across different regions of Singapore.

## Model Building

- **Model Selection**: Explain the rationale behind choosing specific models such as linear regression, decision trees, or neural networks for predicting housing prices.
  
- **Feature Selection**: Discuss techniques used to select relevant features that have the most significant impact on predicting resale flat prices.
  
- **Cross-Validation**: Describe the process of cross-validation to assess the performance of the models and avoid overfitting.
  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Specify evaluation metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) or MAE (Mean Absolute Error) used to assess the accuracy of the models.

## Outlier Detection and Handling

- **Outlier Identification**: Detail methods for identifying outliers, such as z-score, IQR (Interquartile Range), or clustering techniques.
  
- **Outlier Treatment**: Explain strategies for handling outliers, such as removing them, transforming them, or treating them separately in the analysis.
  
- **Impact on Analysis**: Discuss how outliers can skew results and the importance of addressing them for accurate insights.

## Library Utilization

- **Pandas**: Highlight the use of Pandas for data manipulation tasks such as filtering, grouping, and merging datasets.
  
- **NumPy**: Explain how NumPy is used for numerical operations and array manipulations, particularly in preprocessing and feature engineering.
  
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Showcase the creation of various visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to convey insights effectively.
  
- **Scikit-learn**: Discuss the role of Scikit-learn in implementing machine learning models, feature selection, and model evaluation.
